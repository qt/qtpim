    \title Qt Quick Organizer List View Example

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Events List

    This example shows how to write a simple Calendar Event List with the \l {Organizer QML Plugin}{Organizer QML Plugin}

    \section2 Motivation
    This application was written to provide an example to developers of how to use the Qt Quick Organizer and
    Qt Versit APIs.

    It provides an example of how to use the Qt Organizer and Versit libraries to:
    \list
    \o select a backend for volatile memory or persistent storage
    \o list the stored Calendar Events
    \o add Events
    \o edit Events
    \o Remove Events
    \o import Event lists as ICal\reg *
    \endlist

    [*] \i{iCal iCalendar is a standard \l{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545}{(RFC 5545)} for calendar data exchange}

    \section2 Use Case
    Most people have a need to store Calendar reminders for various events ranging from Weddings, hairdresser appointments,
    work meetings to reccuring football training every week.
    This sample application provides a simple Event List  book that allows users
    to retrieve their Calendar Events and modify them, delete them or add new events using either volatile memory of the
    supported backend for the device in use.

    \section2 Interface
    The application is designed to work on desktop and mobile platforms with
    minimal differences in code between the platforms.  The interface is
    organized into a QML List View, showing the Organizer Event List by default.
    Events can be added or deleted using the buttons at the bottom
    of the contact list. Selecting an event is simply done by clicking the
    mouse on the desired event, and using the save button to store it.

    Here we see the \l {OrganizerModel} used with a QML List View to show some Events added by default.

    When editing  you click on the edit button and an Event Editor will be displayed showing
    the display label along with  the start and end dates of the events.

    Here start and end dates or label for the event can be modified. Notice that the boundaries have been set so that
    any character can be used in the label. However the date, month and the year are limited
    to integers which match those fields to give some kind of simple but sensible user interaction.
    When finished select either the cancel button or the save button and it returns to the
    list view showing all events. If cancel button is pressed nothing will change, or if saved the modifications
    to the event will be updated in this main list view.

    Adding new events from the main list view is equally simple. Click on add new event button and the same editor
    will be displayed with NEW in the event title as follows.

    Simply Edit this as with any other event, and cancel or save it. Cancelling will mean this new event will be lost,
    where saving will add the new event to the main list view along with all the other existing events.

    Deleting events from the main list view is simply done by pressing the delete button and the currently highlighted
    event will be removed from the organizer list view and also the backend where this event is stored.

    \section2 Known Issues
    The example is not intended to be feature complete.  Only a very limited subset of detail types are
    supported by the application.  It exercises only a very small portion of the Qt Organizer QML API.
    It is intended to be very simple to show the API and allow the developers skilled in QML to utilise
    this interface to its full potential.

    In particular:
    \list
        \o The example only exercises the QML OrganizerModel  API to save, edit and delete Events.
        \o Everything is done with minimal external components or states to keep things simple and focused
           on how the API works.
        \o Editing a Date/Time is in string format. In a real application would be a more advanced
           component on its own which would allow easy and simple user input with good error checking and
           error messages for the user.
