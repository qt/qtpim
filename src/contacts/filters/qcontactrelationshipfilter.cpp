  \class QContactRelationshipFilter
  \brief The QContactRelationshipFilter class provides a filter based
  around relationship criteria.


  \inmodule QtContacts

  \ingroup contacts-filters

  It may be used to select contacts which are involved in relationships
  which are of a certain type, or which involve certain contacts.

  One common use-case might be to select the contacts which are a member of a particular group.
  This use-case may be met with the following filter:

  \code
  QContactRelationshipFilter groupFilter;                               // select all contacts which are involved
  groupFilter.setRelationshipType(QContactRelationship::HasMember);     // in a group relationship
  groupFilter.setRelatedContact(groupContact());                   // with the group contact
  groupFilter.setRelatedContactRole(QContactRelationship::First); // where the group contact is the first participant
  \endcode

  Another common use-case might be to select the groups which a particular contact is a member of.
  This use-case may be met with the following filter:

  \code
  QContactRelationshipFilter whichGroupsFilter;                                 // select all contacts which are involved
  whichGroupsFilter.setRelationshipType(QContactRelationship::HasMember); // in a group relationship
  whichGroupsFilter.setRelatedContact(particularContact());                // with the particular contact
  whichGroupsFilter.setRelatedContactRole(QContactRelationship::Second);  // where the particular contact is the second participant
  \endcode
