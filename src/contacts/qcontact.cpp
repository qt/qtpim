  \class QContact

  \brief The QContact class represents an addressbook contact.

  \inmodule QtContacts

  \ingroup contacts-main

  Individual contacts, groups, and other types of contacts are represented with
  a QContact object.  In addition to the type, a QContact consists of information
  that belongs to the contact, some information about the relationships that the
  contact has, and the preferred ways to interact with the contact.

  A QContact object has a collection of details (like a name, phone numbers and
  email addresses).  Each detail (which can have multiple fields) is stored
  in an appropriate subclass of QContactDetail, and the QContact allows
  retrieving these details in various ways.

  Depending on the details of the QContact, certain actions are available for a
  contact.  An instance of a QContact can return a list of actions that can be
  performed on it, and a list of details supported by a specific action can be
  retrieved (for example - a list of phone numbers supported by a specific "Call" action).
  It is also possible to store one detail for each type of action that is the "preferred"
  detail to use.

  A QContact may have zero or more relationships with other contacts.  For example,
  a group contact would have a \c "HasMember" relationship with the QContacts that
  are its members.  Spouses, managers and assistants can also be represented this
  way.

  A QContact instance represents the in-memory version of an addressbook contact,
  and has no tie to a specific QContactManager.  It is possible for the contents
  of a QContact to change independently of the contents that are stored persistently
  in a QContactManager.  A QContact has an ID associated with it when it is first
  retrieved from a QContactManager, or after it has been first saved, and this allows
  clients to track changes using the signals in QContactManager.

  A QContact has a number of mandatory details:
  \list
   \li A QContactType, with the type of the contact (individual contact, group etc)
  \endlist

  \sa QContactManager, QContactDetail
