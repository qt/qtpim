  \class QContactAbstractRequest

  \brief The QContactAbstractRequest class provides a mechanism for
  asynchronous requests to be made of a manager if it supports them.

  \inmodule QtContacts
  \since 1.0

  \ingroup contacts-main

  It allows a client to asynchronously request some functionality of a
  particular QContactManager.  Instances of the class will emit signals
  when the state of the request changes, or when more results become
  available.

  Clients should not attempt to create instances of this class directly,
  but should instead use the use-case-specific classes derived from this
  class.

  All such request classes have a similar interface: clients set the
  parameters of the asynchronous call, including which manager the
  request will be made of, and then call the start() slot of the request.
  The manager will then enqueue or begin to process the request, at which
  point the request's state will transition from \c InactiveState to
  \c ActiveState.  After any state transition, the request will emit the
  stateChanged() signal.  The manager may periodically update the request
  with results, at which point the request will emit the resultsAvailable()
  signal.  These results are not guaranteed to have a stable ordering.
  Error information is considered a result, so some requests will emit the
  resultsAvailable() signal even if no results are possible from the request
  (for example, a contact remove request) when the manager updates the request
  with information about any errors which may have occurred.

  Please see the class documentation of each of the use-case-specific
  classes derived from this class for information about how to retrieve
  the results of a request (including error information).  In all cases,
  those functions are synchronous, and will return the cached result set with
  which the manager has updated the request instance if the resultsAvailable()
  signal has been emitted.

  Clients can choose which signals they wish to handle from a request.
  If the client is not interested in interim results, they can choose to
  handle only the stateChanged() signal, and in the slot to which that
  signal is connected, check whether the state has changed to either
  \c FinishedState or \c CanceledState (both of which signify that the
  manager has finished handling the request, and that the request will not
  be updated with any more results).  If the client is not interested in
  any results (including error information), they may choose to delete
  the request after calling \l start(), or simply not connect the
  request's signals to any slots.

  If the request is allocated via operator new, the client must
  delete the request when they are no longer using it in order to avoid
  leaking memory.  That is, the client retains ownership of the request.

  The client may delete a heap-allocated request in various ways:
  by deleting it directly (but not within a slot connected to a signal
  emitted by the request), or by using the deleteLater() slot to schedule
  the request for deletion when control returns to the event loop (from
  within a slot connected to a signal emitted by the request, for example
  \l stateChanged()).

  An active request may be deleted by the client, but the client will not
  receive any notifications about whether the request succeeded or not,
  nor any results of the request.

  Because clients retain ownership of any request object, and may delete
  a request object at any time, manager engine implementors must be careful
  to ensure that they do not assume that a request has not been deleted
  at some point during processing of a request, particularly if the engine
  has a multithreaded implementation.  It is suggested that engine
  implementors read the \l{Qt Contacts Manager Engines} documentation for
  more information on this topic.
