  \class QContactAction
  \brief The QContactAction class provides an interface for performing an
  action on a QContact or QContactDetail.
  \ingroup contacts-main
  \ingroup contacts-actions

  \inmodule QtContacts

  An action is anything that can be performed on a contact, or a detail of a contact.  An example
  of an action might be "Send Email" or "Dial" or "Plot Navigation Route".  One action may be
  implemented by multiple vendors, and indeed one vendor may provide multiple implementations of
  the same action.  The name of an action identifies its semantics, while its implementation version
  distinguishes it from other implementations of the action by the same vendor.

  Invocation of an action is asynchronous; at some stage after calling \l invokeAction() the
  action instance will emit the \l stateChanged() signal.  Any results of the action may be retrieved
  by calling \l results(), and as results become available the action will emit \l resultsAvailable().

  Each instance of a QContactAction is created by a \l QContactActionFactory when
  \l QContactAction::action() is called; the caller takes ownership of the action instance.
  Each action is uniquely described by a \l QContactActionDescriptor, which is passed to the
  \l QContactAction::action() function to instantiate an action.

  \sa QContactActionFactory, QContactActionFilter
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::~QContactAction()
  Clears any memory in use by this instance of the action implementation
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::state() const
  Returns the current state of the action.
  \sa stateChanged()
 */


/*!
  \fn QContactAction::invokeAction(const QList<QContactActionTarget>& targets, const QVariantMap& parameters = QVariantMap())
  \overload

  Initiates the action on the specified list of \a targets with the optional supplied \a parameters.

  At some point after invocation, one or more \l resultsAvailable() signals will be emitted by the action instance.
  The results of the action (if any) may be retrieved by calling \l results().
  When the state of the action changes, the \l stateChanged() signal will be emitted.

  Returns true if the action was invoked successfully, otherwise false.  The return value says nothing
  about whether the action which was invoked was successful or not, only whether it was initiated or
  the request for it to be initiated was sent successfully (e.g., if the action is implemented as a one-way
  RPC call).

  \sa results(), stateChanged()

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::invokeAction(const QContact& contact, const QContactDetail& detail = QContactDetail(), const QVariantMap& parameters = QVariantMap())
  \overload

  This is a convenience function.

  Initiates the action on the specified \a detail of the given \a contact, or on the first
  eligible detail saved in the contact if the given \a detail is empty, with the given \a parameters specified.

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::results() const
  Returns the result of the action, if any exists.  Calling this function prior to receiving the \l resultsAvailable()
  signal will not return a meaningful result.

  Describes the current status of the asynchronous action operation
  \value InactiveState The operation has not yet been initiated

  \value FinishedState The operation successfully completed
  \value FinishedWithErrorState The operation has finished, but an error occurred
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactAction::resultsAvailable()
  This signal is emitted by an action instance whose functionality has been initiated with \l invokeAction()
  when results of the action are available.  Not all actions will have results, and these
  actions will not emit the resultsAvailable() signal.

  If the action implementation is incapable of reporting results of the operation (for example, the
  action is implemented via a one-way IPC call) it should transition to the \c QContactAction::FinishedDetachedState state
  immediately upon invocation.
