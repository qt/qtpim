  \class QContactManager
  \brief The QContactManager class provides an interface which allows clients with access to contact information stored in a particular backend.
  \inmodule QtContacts

  \ingroup contacts-main

  This class provides an abstraction of a datastore or aggregation of datastores which contains contact information.
  It provides methods to retrieve and manipulate contact information and contact relationship information.
  It also provides metadata and error information reporting.

  The functions provided by QContactManager are purely synchronous; to access the same functionality in an
  asynchronous manner, clients should use the use-case-specific classes derived from QContactAbstractRequest.

  Some functionality provided by QContactManager directly is not accessible using the asynchronous API. See
  the \l{Qt Contacts Synchronous API}{synchronous} and \l{Qt Contacts Asynchronous API}{asynchronous} API
  information in the \l{Qt Contacts C++ API} documentation.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::dataChanged()
  This signal is emitted by the manager if its internal state changes, and it is unable to determine the changes
  which occurred, or if the manager considers the changes to be radical enough to require clients to reload all data.
  If this signal is emitted, no other signals will be emitted for the associated changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::contactsAdded(const QList<QContactId>& contactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point once the contacts identified by \a contactIds have been added to a datastore managed by this manager.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::contactsChanged(const QList<QContactId>& contactIds, const QList<QContactDetail::DetailType> &typesChanged)
  This signal is emitted at some point once the contacts identified by \a contactIds have been modified in a datastore managed by this manager.
  The set of contact detail types modified in the reported changes is a subset of those listed in \a typesChanged,
  unless \a typesChanged is empty, in which case no limitation on the reported changes may be assumed.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::contactsRemoved(const QList<QContactId>& contactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point once the contacts identified by \a contactIds have been removed from a datastore managed by this manager.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::relationshipsAdded(const QList<QContactId>& affectedContactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point after relationships have been added to the manager which involve the contacts identified by \a affectedContactIds.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::relationshipsRemoved(const QList<QContactId>& affectedContactIds)
  This signal is emitted at some point after relationships have eben removed from the manager which involve the contacts identified by \a affectedContactIds.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for these changes.
 */

/*!
  \fn QContactManager::selfContactIdChanged(const QContactId& oldId, const QContactId& newId)
  This signal is emitted at some point after the id of the self-contact is changed from \a oldId to \a newId in the manager.
  If the \a newId is the invalid, then the self contact was deleted or no self contact exists.
  This signal must not be emitted if the dataChanged() signal was previously emitted for this change.

   The string constant for the parameter key which holds the names of detail definitions.

   changes which might otherwise cause a signal to be emitted, involve details whose
   definition name is not contained in the given list.

   That is, if a detail in a contact is changed, but that detail's definition name is
   not listed in the value for this parameter, the manager will not emit a change signal
   for that change.

   If this parameter is not specified at construction time, changes to any detail of a contact
   will cause a change signal to be emitted.

   The value of this parameter should be a comma (,) separated list of definition names.  Any
   commas which might be part of a definition name must be escaped with a single backslash
   (\) character prior to concatenation.  Any backslash character which might be part of a
   definition name must also be escaped with a backslash.

   to the client if the client calls managerParameters() subsequent to manager construction.

   the data as it is stored in the backend, but does not wish to be
