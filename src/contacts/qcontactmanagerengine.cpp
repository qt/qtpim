  \class QContactManagerEngine
  \brief The QContactManagerEngine class provides the interface for
  implementations of the contact manager backend functionality.
  \inmodule QtContacts

  \ingroup contacts-backends
  \since 2.0

  Instances of this class are usually provided by a
  \l QContactManagerEngineFactory, which is loaded from a plugin.

  The default implementation of this interface provides a basic
  level of functionality for some functions so that specific engines
  can simply implement the functionality that is supported by
  the specific contacts engine that is being adapted.

  More information on writing a contacts engine plugin is available in
  the \l{Qt Contacts Manager Engines} documentation.

  If this signal is emitted, no other signals may be emitted for the associated changes.

  a locale aware comparison is used, and if the sensitivity is
  CaseSensitive, strings that are identical under a case insensitive
  sort are then sorted case sensitively within that context.

  For example:

  aaron
  Bob
  Aaron
  aAron
  Carol

  would sort as:

  aaron
  aAron
  Aaron
  Bob
  Carol

  Returns:
  <0 if \a first is less than \a second
   0 if \a first is equal to \a second
  >0 if \a first is greater than \a second.

  The results are undefined if the variants are different types, or
  cannot be compared.

  \class QContactManagerEngineV2
  \brief The QContactManagerEngineV2 class provides the interface for
  implementations of the contact manager backend functionality.
  \inmodule QtContacts

  \ingroup contacts-backends

  Instances of this class are usually provided by a
  \l QContactManagerEngineFactory, which is loaded from a plugin.

  The default implementation of this interface provides a basic
  level of functionality for some functions so that specific engines
  can simply implement the functionality that is supported by
  the specific contacts engine that is being adapted.

  More information on writing a contacts engine plugin is available in
  the \l{Qt Contacts Manager Engines} documentation.

  Engines that support the QContactManagerEngine interface but not the
  QContactManagerEngineV2 interface will be wrapped by the QContactManager
  by a class that emulates the extra functionality of the
  QContactManagerEngineV2 interface.
