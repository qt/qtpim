/*!
  \class QContactDetailDefinitionSaveRequest
  \brief The QContactDetailDefinitionSaveRequest class allows a client to
  asynchronously request that certain detail definitions be saved in a
  contacts store.

  For a QContactDetailDefinitionSaveRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when
  either the individual item errors (which may be retrieved by calling errorMap()), or the resultant
  detail definitions (which may be retrieved by calling definitions()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

  Please see the class documentation of QContactAbstractRequest for more information about
  the usage of request classes and ownership semantics.
