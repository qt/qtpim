  \class QContactFetchByIdRequest
  \brief The QContactFetchByIdRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request contacts from a contacts store manager, given a list of contact IDs.

  The contacts fetched by the backend should have a one-to-one correspondence to the
  IDs passed into this class.  That is, the nth contact in the returned list should
  have an ID which is equal to the nth ID in the list of IDs.  Any invalid ID should
  correspond to an empty QContact.

  For a QContactFetchByIdRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the
  resultant contacts (which may be retrieved by calling contacts()), are updated, as well
  as if the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is
  updated.

  Please see the class documentation of QContactAbstractRequest for more information about
  the usage of request classes and ownership semantics.
