  \class QContactFetchRequest
  \brief The QContactFetchRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request contacts from a contacts store manager.


  For a QContactFetchRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the resultant
  contacts (which may be retrieved by calling contacts()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

  Please see the class documentation of QContactAbstractRequest for more information about
  the usage of request classes and ownership semantics.
