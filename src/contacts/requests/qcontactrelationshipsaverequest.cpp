  \class QContactRelationshipSaveRequest
  \brief The QContactRelationshipSaveRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request that certain groups be saved to a contacts store.

  For a QContactRelationshipSaveRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when
  either the individual item errors (which may be retrieved by calling errorMap()), or the resultant
  relationships (which may be retrieved by calling relationships()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

  Please see the class documentation of QContactAbstractRequest for more information about
  the usage of request classes and ownership semantics.
