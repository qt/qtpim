  \class QContactSaveRequest
  \brief The QContactSaveRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request that certain contacts be saved to a contacts store.

  For a QContactSaveRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when
  either the individual item errors (which may be retrieved by calling errorMap()), or the resultant
  contacts (which may be retrieved by calling contacts()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.

  Please see the class documentation of QContactAbstractRequest for more information about
  the usage of request classes and ownership semantics.

/*!
    Set the list of definitions to restrict saving to \a definitionMask.  This allows you to perform
    partial save (and remove) operations on existing contacts.

    If \a definitionMask is empty (the default), no restrictions will apply, and the passed
    in contacts will be saved as is.  Otherwise, only details whose definitions are in
    the list will be saved.  If a definition name is present in the list, but there are no
    corresponding details in the contact passed into this request, any existing details in
    the manager for that contact will be removed.

    This is useful if you've used a fetch hint to fetch a partial contact from a manager
    so that you can save changes to the details you actually fetched without removing
    the details you didn't.

    Additionally, when performing synchronization operations with other managers that don't
    support the full range of details, you can restrict the update operation to only those
    details so that you don't lose the extra details that are supported in this manager.

    \note Some managers do not support partial updates natively, in which case the QtContacts
    framework will emulate the functionality (fetching the whole contact, applying the
    new restricted details, and saving the contact back).
