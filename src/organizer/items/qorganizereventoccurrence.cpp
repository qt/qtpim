  \class QOrganizerEventOccurrence
  \brief The QOrganizerEventOccurrence class provides an occurrence of an event.
  \inmodule QtOrganizer
  \ingroup organizer-items

  An event occurrence is where the occurrence differs from the generating
  event in some way.  An occurrence which is retrieved from a manager may not
  actually be persisted in that manager (for example, it may be generated
  automatically from the recurrence rule of the parent event stored in the
  manager), in which case it will have a zero-id and differ from the parent
  event only in its start date. Alternatively, it may be persisted in the
  manager (that is, the client has saved the occurrence previously) where it
  is stored as an exception to its parent event.
