/*!
  \class QOrganizerAbstractRequest

  \brief The QOrganizerAbstractRequest class provides a mechanism for
  asynchronous requests to be made of a manager if it supports them.

  \inmodule QtOrganizer

  \ingroup organizer-main

  It allows a client to asynchronously request some functionality of a
  particular QOrganizerManager.  Instances of the class will emit signals
  when the state of the request changes, or when more results become
  available.

  Clients should not attempt to create instances of this class directly,
  but should instead use the use-case-specific classes derived from this
  class.

  After creating any sort of request, the client retains ownership and
  must delete the request to avoid leaking memory.  The client may either
  do this directly (if not within a slot connected to a signal emitted
  by the request) or by using the deleteLater() slot to schedule the
  request for deletion when control returns to the event loop.
 */

/*!
  \fn QOrganizerAbstractRequest::stateChanged(QOrganizerAbstractRequest::State newState)
  This signal is emitted when the state of the request is changed.  The new state of
  the request will be contained in \a newState.
 */


/*!
  \fn QOrganizerAbstractRequest::resultsAvailable()
  This signal is emitted when new results are available.  Results can include
  the operation error which may be accessed via error(), or derived-class-specific
  results which are accessible through the derived class API.

  \sa error()
