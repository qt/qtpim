  \macro Q_DECLARE_CUSTOM_ORGANIZER_ITEM
  \relates QOrganizerItem

  Macro for simplifying declaring convenience leaf classes for QOrganizerItem.

  The first argument is the name of the class, and the second argument
  is a Latin-1 string literal naming the item type.

  If you are creating a convenience class for a type of QOrganizerItem,
  you should use this macro when declaring your class to ensure that
  it interoperates with other organizer item functionality.

  \class QOrganizerItem

  \brief The QOrganizerItem class represents an event, todo, note, or journal entry

  \inmodule QtOrganizer
  \since 1.1

  \ingroup organizer-main

  A QOrganizerItem object has an id and a collection of details (like a start date and location), as
  well as a collection id which identifies which QOrganizerCollection the item is part of in a manager.
  Each detail (which can have multiple fields) is stored in an appropriate subclass of QOrganizerItemDetail,
  and the QOrganizerItem allows retrieving these details in various ways. QOrganizerItemCustomDetail is
  supposed to be used to store user specific details that are not pre-defined in the detal leaf classes.

  Most clients will want to use the convenient subclasses of QOrganizerItem (i.e., QOrganizerEvent
  (and QOrganizerEventOccurence), QOrganizerTodo (and QOrganizerTodoOccurence), QOrganizerJournal and
  QOrganizerNote) instead of manipulating instances of QOrganizerItem directly.

  A QOrganizerItem instance represents the in-memory version of a calendar organizer item.
  It is possible for the contents of a QOrganizerItem to change independently of the contents
  that are stored persistently in a QOrganizerManager.  A QOrganizerItem has an id associated
  with it when it is first retrieved from a QOrganizerManager, or after it has been first saved,
  and this allows clients to track changes using the signals in QOrganizerManager.  When saved
  in a manager, every item is placed into a QOrganizerCollection in that manager, according
  to the collection id set in the item prior to save (or the default collection if no
  collection id was set in the item).

  Different QOrganizerManagers may require an item to have certain details saved in it before
  it can be stored in that manager.  By default, every item must have a QOrganizerItemType
  detail which identifies the type of the item.  Different subclasses of QOrganizerItem
  (i.e., QOrganizerEvent (and QOrganizerEventOccurence), QOrganizerTodo (and QOrganizerTodoOccurence),
  QOrganizerJournal and QOrganizerNote) may have other mandatory details, depending on the manager.
