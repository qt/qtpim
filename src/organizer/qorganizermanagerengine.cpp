  \class QOrganizerManagerEngine
  \brief The QOrganizerManagerEngine class provides the interface for all
  implementations of the organizer item manager backend functionality.

  \inmodule QtOrganizer
  \ingroup organizer-backends

  Instances of this class are usually provided by a
  \l QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory, which is loaded from a plugin.

  The default implementation of this interface provides a basic
  level of functionality for some functions so that specific engines
  can simply implement the functionality that is supported by
  the specific organizer items engine that is being adapted.

  More information on writing an organizer engine plugin is available in
  the \l{Qt Organizer Manager Engines} documentation.

  \fn QOrganizerManagerEngine::dataChanged()

  This signal is emitted some time after changes occur to the data managed by this

  engine considers the changes to be radical enough to require clients to reload all data.

  If this signal is emitted, no other signals may be emitted for the associated changes.

  As it is possible that other processes (or other devices) may have caused the
  changes, the timing can not be determined.

  As it is possible that other processes (or other devices) may
  have added the organizer items, the timing cannot be determined.

  Return the list of a maximum of \a maxCount organizer item instances which are occurrences of the

  \a periodEnd date.

  If \a periodStart is after \a periodEnd, the operation will fail, and \a error will be set to \c
  QOrganizerManager::BadArgumentError.
  If \a maxCount is negative, it is backend specific as to how many occurrences will be returned.
  Some backends may return no instances, others may return some limited number of occurrences.

  If the \a parentItem is an item of type QOrganizerItemType::TypeEvent, a list of items of type
  QOrganizerItemType::TypeEventOccurrence will be returned, representing the expansion of the
  parent item according to its QOrganizerItemRecurrence detail.  Similarly, a \a parentItem of type
  QOrganizerItemType::TypeTodo will result in a list of QOrganizerItemType::TypeTodoOccurrence
  items.  If the \a parentItem is of any other type, it is returned by itself from the backend.

  The occurrence-typed items returned should have a QOrganizerItemParent detail that refers
  to the parent item and the original instance that the event would have occurred on (if it is an
  exception).  No returned item should contain a QOrganizerItemRecurrence detail.

  If the \a parentItem does not exist in the backend, or if there are no instances matching the
  criteria, an empty list should be returned.

  The \a fetchHint parameter is a hint to the manager about which details the client is interested
  in.  It allows the manager to optimize retrieval of occurrences.  The manager may ignore the
  \a fetchHint, but if it does so each item occurrence it returns must include all of the details
  associated with it in the database.
