  \class QOrganizerManagerEngine
  \brief The QOrganizerManagerEngine class provides the interface for all
  implementations of the organizer item manager backend functionality.

  \inmodule QtOrganizer
  \ingroup organizer-backends
   \since 1.1

  Instances of this class are usually provided by a
  \l QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory, which is loaded from a plugin.

  The default implementation of this interface provides a basic
  level of functionality for some functions so that specific engines
  can simply implement the functionality that is supported by
  the specific organizer items engine that is being adapted.

  More information on writing an organizer engine plugin is available in
  the \l{Qt Organizer Manager Engines} documentation.

  Engines that support the QOrganizerManagerEngine interface but not the
  QOrganizerManagerEngineV2 interface will be wrapped by the QOrganizerManager
  by a class that emulates the extra functionality of the
  QOrganizerManagerEngineV2 interface.

  The additional features of a V2 engine compared to the original QOrganizerManagerEngine are:
  \list
  \o The items function which takes a \i{maxCount} parameter
  \o The result of the items functions must be sorted by date according to the sort order defined by
     \l itemLessThan()
  \o The corresponding changes to QOrganizerItemFetchRequest
  \endlist

  If \a maxCount is negative, it is backend specific as to how many occurrences will be returned.
  Some backends may return no instances, others may return some limited number of occurrences.

  If the \a parentItem is an item of type QOrganizerItemType::TypeEvent, a list of items of type
  QOrganizerItemType::TypeEventOccurrence will be returned, representing the expansion of the
  parent item according to its QOrganizerItemRecurrence detail.  Similarly, a \a parentItem of type
  QOrganizerItemType::TypeTodo will result in a list of QOrganizerItemType::TypeTodoOccurrence
  items.  If the \a parentItem is of any other type, it is returned by itself from the backend.

  The occurrence-typed items returned should have a QOrganizerItemParent detail that refers
  to the parent item and the original instance that the event would have occurred on (if it is an
  exception).  No returned item should contain a QOrganizerItemRecurrence detail.

  If the \a parentItem does not exist in the backend, or if there are no instances matching the
  criteria, an empty list should be returned.

  The \a fetchHint parameter is a hint to the manager about which details the client is interested
