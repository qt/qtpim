  \class QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory
  \brief The QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory class provides the interface for
 plugins that implement QOrganizerManagerEngine functionality.

  \inmodule QtOrganizer
  \ingroup organizer-backends

  This class provides a simple interface for the creation of
  manager engine instances.  Each factory has a specific id
  associated with it, which forms the \c managerName parameter
  when creating \l QOrganizerManager objects.

  More information on writing a organizeritems engine plugin is available in
  the \l{Qt Organizer Manager Engines} documentation.

/*!
  \fn QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory::engine(const QMap<QString, QString>& parameters, QOrganizerManager::Error* error)

  This function is called by the QOrganizerManager implementation to
  create an instance of the engine provided by this factory.

  The \a parameters supplied can be ignored or interpreted as desired.

  If a supplied parameter results in an unfulfillable request, or some other error
  occurs, this function may return a null pointer, and the client developer will get an
  invalid QOrganizerManager in return.  Any error should be stored in the supplied \a error
  reference.
 */

/*!
  \fn QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory::createCollectionEngineId(const QMap<QString, QString>& parameters, const QString& engineIdString) const

  This function is used internally when deserializing an id.  It allows the
  deserialization functions to correctly allocate an engine-specific
  id for an item, filled with the serialized data \a engineIdString.

  Since the format of the id might be different depending on the construction
  parameters \a parameters, these parameters are passed to the factory implementation
  of this function.

  Engine implementers must implement this function, but should not need
  to call it.

/*!
  \fn QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory::createItemEngineId(const QMap<QString, QString>& parameters, const QString& engineIdString) const

  This function is used internally when deserializing an id.  It allows the
  deserialization functions to correctly allocate an engine-specific
  id for a collection, filled with the serialized data \a engineIdString.

  Since the format of the id might be different depending on the construction
  parameters \a parameters, these parameters are passed to the factory implementation
  of this function.

  Engine implementers must implement this function, but should not need
  to call it.

/*!
  \fn QOrganizerManagerEngineFactory::managerName() const

  This function should return a unique string that identifies
  the engines provided by this factory.

  Typically this would be of the form "com.nokia.qt.organizeritems.engines.memory", with
  the appropriate domain and engine name substituted.
