  \class QOrganizerRecurrenceRule

  \brief The QOrganizerRecurrenceRule class describes the a rule by which a QOrganizerItem repeats.

  \inmodule QtOrganizer

  This class is a mapping of a subset of the iCalendar RRULE property value, and each field in this
  class corresponds to a fragment of iCalendar's RRULE.  This class supports the same fragments as
  those supported by RRULE, except for describing recurrences on a higher frequency than Daily.
  That is, this class doesn't support hourly, minutely or secondly recurrences, nor does it support
  specifying which hour, minute or second of a day to recur on.  These types of rules are
  unsupported because most calendaring backends don't support them, and it simplifies recurrences
  by enforcing that there can be at most one occurrence of an item per day.

  The general rules for interaction between the fields when generating the occurence dates is as
  follows:
  \list
    \o When a criterion takes a list, the items in the list are unioned together.
    \list
      \o eg. with [dayOfWeek == Tuesday,Thursday], the event occurs if it is Tuesday or Thursday
    \endlist

    \o Frequency and specific criteria interact in a more complicated fashion.  For each criterion on a
  larger timespan than the frequency, the dates matching the criterion are intersected with the
  dates resulting from the frequency.
    \list
      \o eg. [frequency = Daily, month = January] means every day in January
  For each criterion on a shorter timespan than the frequency, the criterion is unioned.
      \o eg. [frequency = Weekly, dayOfWeek = Wednesday,Friday] means every Wednesday and Friday of
  every week.
    \endlist
  This makes the frequency field superfluous in many cases when other criteria are present.
  eg. all of the below mean the same thing:
    \list
      \o [frequency = Daily, dayOfWeek = Monday,Tuesday]
      \o [frequency = Weekly, dayOfWeek = Monday,Tuesday]
      \o [frequency = Monthly, dayOfWeek = Monday,Tuesday]
      \o [frequency = Yearly, dayOfWeek = Monday,Tuesday]
    \endlist
  However, the frequency field may start affecting the result differently when other fields are
  added like interval and positions.

  \o For the purpose of calculating occurrence dates, information not contained in the rule is in some
  cases derived from the startDateTime field of the event that the detail is associated with.
  There are three cases where such derivation is necessary.
    \list
      \o Case 1: frequency == Weekly.  If dayOfWeek is not specified, derive it from the week day that
  the startDateTime occurs on.
      \o Case 2: frequency == Monthly.  If neither dayOfWeek or dayOfMonth is specified, dayOfMonth should
  be derived from the startDateTime
      \o Case 3: frequency == Yearly.  If none of monthOfYear, weekOfYear, dayOfYear, dayOfMonth or dayOfWeek
  are specified, derive monthOfYear and dayOfMonth.  If monthOfYear is specified but not weekOfYear, dayOfYear,
  dayOfMonth or dayOfWeek, then derive dayOfMonth.  If weekOfYear is specified but not dayOfYear,
  dayOfWeek or dayOfMonth, derive dayOfWeek from the startDateTime.
  For any cases not covered here, do not derive any of the fields.
    \endlist
  \endlist

  A recurrence rule may be limited by either count or date, or it may be unlimited.
  If limited by count, the series generated by the rule will have at most \c count
  occurrences.  If limited by date, the series generated by the rule may have occurrences
  up to (and including) the limit \c date.  See \l setLimit() for more information on
  this topic.
