  \class QOrganizerCollectionRemoveRequest
  \brief The QOrganizerCollectionRemoveRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request organizeritems from a organizeritems store manager.

  \inmodule QtOrganizer


  For a QOrganizerCollectionRemoveRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the resultant
  organizeritems (which may be retrieved by calling organizeritems()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.
