  \class QOrganizerItemFetchByIdRequest
  \brief The QOrganizerItemFetchByIdRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request items from a items store manager, given a list of item IDs.

  The items fetched by the backend should have a one-to-one correspondence to the
  IDs passed into this class.  That is, the nth item in the returned list should
  have an ID which is equal to the nth ID in the list of IDs.  Any invalid ID should
  correspond to an empty QOrganizerItem.

  For a QOrganizerItemFetchByIdRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the
  resultant items (which may be retrieved by calling items()), are updated, as well
  as if the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is
  updated.

  Please see the class documentation of QOrganizerAbstractRequest for more information about
  the usage of request classes and ownership semantics.
