  \class QOrganizerItemIdFetchRequest
  \brief The QOrganizerItemIdFetchRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request a list of organizer item ids from a organizer item store manager.
  \inmodule QtOrganizer


  For a QOrganizerItemIdFetchRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the resultant
  manager organizer item ids (which may be retrieved by calling ids()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.
