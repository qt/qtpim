  \class QOrganizerItemOccurrenceFetchRequest
  \brief The QOrganizerItemOccurrenceFetchRequest class allows a client to asynchronously
    request occurrences generated by a recurring item.
  \inmodule QtOrganizer
  \since 1.1

  For a QOrganizerItemOccurrenceFetchRequest, the resultsAvailable() signal will be emitted when the resultant
  organizer items (which may be retrieved by calling items()), are updated, as well as if
  the overall operation error (which may be retrieved by calling error()) is updated.
