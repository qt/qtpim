The comparison method used is not exact. The number is compared starting from

ignored when comparing.

Additionally, if the contacts model phone parser (CNTPHONE.DLL) is available,

Notes:
Due to the way numbers are stored in the database, it is recommended that at
least 7 match digits are specified even when matching a number containing fewer
digits. Failure to follow this guideline may (depending on the database contents)
mean that the function will not return the expected Contacts Id set.
