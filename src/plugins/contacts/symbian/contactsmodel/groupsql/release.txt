BR.1615 "PIM Application Services: Move contact database files to contact server private directory"

Note: The dbDumper utility is not updated according to BR.1615.
To be able to use the dbDumper utility do the following:
1. Move the contacts file from \private\10003a73 to \private\100012a5 directory 
2. Rename the file to DBS_100065FF_CONTACTS.CDB

1 new exported API:  CContactDatabase::SetOperationTimeOutL()
Sets the time out of operations on the database server.
The default time out is one second.

This submission contains major changes in the contacts model architecture:
1. Introduction of persistence layer.
2. Most of the business logic moved to the cntsrv component.
3. Improved transaction support.

  CContactOpenOperation* CContactDatabase::Open(const TDesC& aFileName, TRequestStatus& aClientStatus,

When the client supplied TRequestStatus parameter is completed with KErrNone the 
CContactOpenOperation::TakeDatabase method takes ownership of the new CContactDatabase object.

Title: Support for customising sorting of contact views 

Support for a Sort plug-in, based on the ECOM framework, for comparing Contacts view items
when sorting a view.
This release implements all calls to the Sort plug-in and new APIs.
Test coverage includes example/test sort plug-in CntSimpleSortPlugin, new unit test T_ViewSortPlugin
and test cases added to T_ViewSort, T_ViewEvents and T_ViewsOOM.
Caveats are: interaction with PhoneBook Sync may is erroneous, and some minor performance issues,
(sorting a very large view can block the contacts server from processing other things).

Perforce Release 
================

Title: Add support for reading (pronunciation) fields in Contacts model (for e.g. Japanese)

Contacts model is modified to support the new fields in the database tables
CntVCard is modified to add the SOUND extensions into a contact
T_ViewSortProfiling is added to test the performance of view sorting and finding for the 3 new fields
T_CntVcard is modified to rest reading and writing vCards with the new SOUND support
Various other tests are modified to suport the changes.
This is the final of two releases.

PHAR-5K2TAF "Improvements to contacts matching" CR

Functionality: Previous versions of:

CContactDatabase::MatchPhoneNumberL(const TDesc& aNumber, const TInt aMatchLengthFromRight)

matches on a maximum of 7 phone digits, but the function has now been modifed to
match on up to 15 digits. This has been done by adding an extra column to the
Phone table to hold a phone digit hash for the additional digits.

Impact of changes: Existing behaviour has been retained but KMaxPhoneMatchLength
has been changed from 7 to 15. Any code or test code that uses this constant when
calling MatchPhoneNumberL(...) will see a change in behaviour. When an existing
database is opened it will be updated (if necessary) to the new schema during the
opening process. It will not be possible to read and update databases with a version
number earlier than 5.

The changes are source and binary with existing code.

- Skipped T_ERROR tests which fail, so T_ERROR runs on WINS without failure
- Renamed method parameters in CContactTables to conform with 
coding standards


Perforce release
================
Made by ChrisD/GrahamO/JoeB 3rd August 2001

Not source or binary compatible with the previous release.

API changes:
CViewContact::Field() now returns a TPtrC rather than a const TDesC&
Removed method CContactViewBase::NotifyObserversAsync()
Removed method CContactDatabase::ContactsMatchingHintField()

From ChrisD:
Fixed regression in asynchronous sort caused by new table structure (can be 
verified by t_profile).
Used RPointerArray rather than CArrayPtrFlat for speeddial and current item classes.
Added new filtered view options EHome and EWork for Quartz and minimal testcode.
Removed all remaining code warrior warnings shown in Mainline 465.
Removed unused enum TTextDefFindState from cntdb.h
Fixed defect in T_BENCH so command line parameters can be used again
Reorganised Contacts model vCard converter DLL code and added Javadoc comments.
Changed DISTRIBUTION.POLICY files for Cntvcard and Documentation directories
from category D to E (approved by IPR change requests CDUG-4YYKPM and SCHM-4YYHWU)
Removed unnecessary CContactDatabase::ContactsMatchingHintFieldL() method.
Removed unsupported ConvertV6ContactsDatabaseIfNeededL() method.

From JoeB/GrahamO:
Lots of views defect fixes! (details below)

Changed the events sent by CContactLocal view after a re-sort, because it
was causing certain views to re-construct themselves twice. The events sent
on re-sort are now EUnavailable then ESortOrderChanged, rather than 
EUnavailable, ESortOrderChanged then EReady. ESortOrderChanged implies
that the view is ready and waiting.

Fixed defect in CContactFilteredView::HandleRemoveEventL() so that it doesn't 
access the underlying view with the deleted contact's index.

Fixed defect when a CContactLocalView is created while the creating thread has
outstanding EContactDbObserverEventContactAdded events. This could cause
the local view to end up with duplicated contacts.

Fixed defect in CContactDatabase::CreatePhoneMatchNumberL() which assumed 
phone number was at least 256 characters, if the phone parser didn't exist.

Fixed defect concerning update of the groups view, if the group itself changes.
The original code only coped with contacts being changed and not groups.

Fixed defect caused if CContactLocalView::SortL() is called twice. If it is called 
before the sort has finished, it now cancels the active object then restarts it.

A queue of outstanding notifications has been added to CContactViewBase 
to allow multiple subviews to be created synchronously when they are based 
on the same underlying view.

A performance improvement has been made by modifying CViewContact from 
holding an array of HBufC's to a single HBuf with an array of integers to index
the fields. The single HBufC solution should make sorting and inserting contacts 
into the views faster as we don't have to concatenate their fields to compare them.

Joe investigated a potential problem concerning construction of child views. 
These views rely on the underlying parent view staying consistent during their
asynchronous construction. We initially thought this problem could be resolved
by locking the parent view whilst the child was constructed. However, this 
work was abandoned because the locking strategy chosen was fundamentally
flawed. Joe summarised his findings as follows

"It is not possible to know the state of the database underlying a view at the point
the lock is requested, and so the lock is meaningless.

Current thoughts on the subject are that any locking strategy is probably over the
top for the requirements of the system - the only time when multiple clients will
be editing the database concurrently is when a sync is happening, and we're probably
going to disable all notifications then anyway. So, I think we're going to live
with the fact that views may be out of sync with the underlying data, and be soft
on (i.e. not panic) client that request data that is no longer present. This at least
will result in a semi-meaningful error dialog. There may be cases where the user requests
to edit an entry and is actually presented with a different entry. Shouldn't be
very common, and so we can probably live with this.
	
Another stategy was considered (idea from Dave Amos). This involved views maintaining
a "synchronisation level id" between parents and children. Then when a child makes a
request on a parent, the child provides its id and the parent can use this to know
if the child is in sync or not. The problem with this strategy is that there's nothing
particularly sensible that the UI code can do beyond displaying a cryptic error
message, so it doesn't appear to help very much."

As a result of Joe's investigation, the debug assertions for invalid view indexes have 
been changed to User::Leave(KErrNotFound). This prevents the situation where a 
the lock server could be panic'd if a child view asks the remote view for a contact 
that doesn't exist in the view. This could be caused because the child view didn't 
recieve a notification in time for example. We thought it would be very rare for this
to happen, and so we just leave rather than panic.

Contact View API defect fixes from GrahamO. This release fixes problems 
caused when a contact id is added and removed from the underlying view, 
causing the mappings in the filtered and group views to be out of date. 
Also, CContactLocalView::HandleDatabaseEventL no longer notifies events 
with an ID of -1.

Perforce release
================
Made by ChrisD 28th June 2001

Added new phone number parsing library to contacts model. 
This is required to avoid incorrect matches for phone number fields which 
contain DTMF or supplementary service information. The library takes a 
contacts phone number field and returns a descriptor with the raw phone 
number (ie. without the DTMF and Supplementary service code parts of 
the number). 

This library is dynamically loaded the first time it is required and is kept 
loaded until the CContactDatabase object is destroyed. 

GT provides a reference implementation which conforms to the relevant
ETSI specifications. However, licensees are free to implement their own 
phone parser library which conforms to the interface defined. The second 
UID of the DLL needs to be 0x101F3D58 (KUidContactsPhoneNumParserDll).

If no library can be found, cntmodel reverts to the previous behaviour and 
will use all digits in the phone number field to determine the match.

Other changes in this release
- Integrated fix for CContactViewBase::Close() suggested by Sami Rosendahl (Digita).
- Encapsulated public member data in CViewContact and provided two new methods
for view clients, Field() and Count(), 
- Removed unused variable warnings in release builds
- Added a new base class for contacts plug-ins which the vCard converter and phone 
number parser use.
- Deprecated old phone matching interfaces and removed the phone matching code
from the lock server.
- Minor ROM size reduction changes
- Fixes for the following defects
DUG-4VYPUP "Spelling mistake in CCntFilter API"
DUG-4W6C2P "Calling CCntFilter::Reset() before calling FilterDatabaseL causes access violation"
CHM-4XVEHB "Contacts server doesn't name its thread"

Perforce release
================
Made by GrahamO/JoeB/ChrisD 22nd June 2001

First integration of LPD contacts model optimisation work to the mainline.
This introduces a new contact view library and API. See in-source docs
for more details.

All recent 6.0 & 6.1 fixes have been integrated into this code, including:
EDNMBEN-4WCDPV "Phone match length specified incorrectly".
EDNJKOO-4W4CWJ "Deleting CContactDatabase causes troubles" 
DUG-4WBEQG "Contacts model base64 workaround needs to be removed"
EDNJKAA-4WLDAY "Cannot synchronise Outlook contacts with German device"

CContactDatabase::MatchPhoneNumberL() now uses the 7 rightmost digits of the 
phone number when matching. The date separator set in the current locale is 
checked to ensure that it won't cause TTime::Parse() to fail when the SQL is executed.


Perforce release
================
Made by ChrisD 4th April 2001

Fixed the following defects
NIN-4T9KFR "Contacts takes too long time to start up at first time with 500 or 700 entries"
DUG-4VGHGC "Regression in Current item support"
EXT-4UTCCX "RemoveSpeedDialFieldL opens a already open contact item"
Revised fix for CHM-4V3MHM "No notification sent if members of a group are changes"

This release integrates the asynchronous sorting API from ER5u.
void SortAsyncL(CArrayFix<TSortPref>* aSortOrder, TRequestStatus& aStatus);
void SortAsyncL(CArrayFix<TSortPref>* aSortOrder, TRequestStatus& aStatus, MContactSortObserver& aObserver);
void CancelAsyncSort();

The API is not dissimilar to the synchronous version, taking a sort order array as
the primary parameter, and, specific to the asynch version, a TRequestStatus that will
be signalled upon completion of the sort. In addition, an optional observer may be
specified, and will be used to report progress during the reading of the contacts
from the database (the slowest aspect of the sorting process). 

The observer mixin call-back allows the contacts database to report the number of contacts
read so far, and the total number remaining. Clients may use this information to present
graphical progress reporting on slow hardware.

The asynchronous sort expects that you don't call other contacts model methods without 
aborting the sort. If you start a sort and need to add a contact, you need to cancel the 
sort and restart the sort.

A new test code project, T_PROFILE has been added to illustrate the use of the new API
and provide test cases for completed asynchronous sorting, and cancelled sorting.

================
Made by ChrisD 19th October 2000

Fixed the following defect 
EDNAPIN-4NYE3R "CntModel does not support opening of read-only databases". 

The model has been changed so that it tries to open the contacts database 
file read/write and if that fails, it tries to open the file read only. If it fails 
to open it read only, the error is propagated to the client to handle.

Fix for the following defects
EDNCDUG-4LYJ8N "EStreamCannotSeek panic when adding long notes field"
EDNPPKN-4L5F2K "transactions in cntmodel"

This release adds new methods to enable clients to begin and commit a 
transaction without placing a cleanup item to rollback the database onto the 
cleanup stack. The database can be explicitly rolled back by calling a seperate
method. 

The methods are : 
void CContactDatabase::DatabaseBeginL(TBool aIsInTransaction);
void CContactDatabase::DatabaseCommitL(TBool aIsInTransaction);
void CContactDatabase::DatabaseRollback();

Added new test unit, T_SIZE, which generates worst-case deletions to monitor
file growth.


Perforce release
================
Made by ChrisD 23rd June 2000

This release integrates Steve Townsend's speed improvements to group loading 
and bug fixes for rollback in CNTMODEL.

Added new base class, CContactItemPlusGroup, to remove the duplication of 
group functionality. This is now the new base for CContactGroup, CContactCard 
and CContactOwnCard. This is hidden from external clients - so no changes are 
necessary for applications.

To speed up loading of groups, a second group table has been added which stores 
the groups as arrays containing the id's of all contacts in a group. This has a lower 
overhead than a second group index.

Corrected GroupsJoinedLC() methods so that they return an empty array rather than 
NULL for an empty list to avoid catching out clients that forget to check for NULL before 
trying to use the array. Removed use of temporary heap allocations for SQL statements 
to reduce heap churning.

Fixed the following defects
EDNMKOS-4L4HPV "CContactDatabase::iCurrentItemId is not saved in database"
EDNCDUG-4LHDR7 "Template fields aren't being restored for contacts imported via vCard"

Fully source and binary compatible. The database format has changed so you need to delete 
old databases before running the emulator.


Perforce release
================
Made by ChrisD 8th June 2000

Integrates source incompatible changes made by Steve Townsend. This release
adds caching for multiple templates and a new database structure.

An optimisation has been found by splitting the blob column into two. Search 
speed is improved since the model doesn't need to read as much data in when 
it searches through the contacts. This takes advantage of a DBMS optimisation 
where columns under 255 bytes are read in a single pass.

API changes as follows: 
Added const parameter to function CContactItemField::IsTemplateLabelField()
Changed signature of CContactItemFieldSet::RestoreL
Changed signature of CContactItemFieldSet::StoreL

Fixed the following defect
EDNMBEN-4L3HXX "Setting speed dial #9 causes panic"


Perforce release 
================
Made by ChrisD 1st June 2000

Perforce release 
================
Made by ChrisD 5 May 2000

Minor changes to CNTVCARD to allow clients to import/export PHOTO and LOGO 
properties via vCard. This uses the new functionality implemented in Versit.

All testcode runs on wins udeb successfully (except t_error)

Perforce release 
================
Made by ChrisD 2 May 2000

Fixed the following defects
EDNASAE-4JHCE4 "Contacts will not sort correctly for different locales"
EDNRTRN-4J5C5E "Groups in Cntmodel cannot be renamed if ..."
EDNCDUG-4JGJMQ "CContactStoreField stores binary data in HBufC rather than HBufC8"

Added reserved functions to CContactFieldStorage derived classes for BC proofing. 
Removed calls to depreciated User::Hal functions, cntmodel will use a Machine UID 
of zero until a long-term solution for Contact UID generation is established. 

This release does not import or export PHOTO or LOGO properties, since this requires
new functionality to be implemented in Versit (the vCard parser).


Perforce release 
================
Made by ChrisD 17 April 2000

Fixed the following defects
EDNMMIR-4JCCQD "CNTMODEL.IBY includes localisable items"

EDNBWHE-4HXCXM "group retains link to a nested group after it has been deleted"

Removed build warnings in cntfilt.cpp, cntitem.cpp & cntsrv.cpp. All testcode runs on wins udeb
with the exception of T_ERROR.


Version 0.00.063
================
Made by StephanieR 5 May 1999

This release is attended for ER5U.
Merged in fix from licensee specific patch released in 047
Uses versit 042

Version 0.00.062
================
Made by StephanieR 17 March 1999

This release is attended for ER5U.
Works with full unicode characters in label text and field contents
Now uses Versit 041 and Conarc 031

Version 0.00.061
================
Made by StephanieR 4 March 1999

This release is attended for ER5U.

Added fix from release 045
Fixed few problems highlighted in code review
Changed find code to use views rather than tables
Two version of find for multiple words have been tested for speed, one using SQL AND, 
and one using a SQL search on first word only. The SQL AND version showed to be slightly faster.
Now uses Versit 040 and Conarc 030



Version 0.00.060
================
Made by StephanieR 25 Feb 1999

Note for Rom building: cntvcard.dll must now be included in ROM.

This release is attended for ER5U.

1. the vcard import/export routines are now in a separate dll cntvcard.dll 
which is loaded when necessary

2. File format changes:
	Removed DeleteFlag column
	Added a text column, where the content of text fields is stored
	Using TCardinality to store counts
	Hint,Extra Fieldtypes and labels are now stored inline in the blob rootstream



Version 0.00.044
================
Made by SteveT 15 Feb 1999

1:"Personal pager" text changed to "Pager";

2:New functions intend for debug use only, these are not approved for use in
ROM apps.
IMPORT_C TInt BlobSizeL(TContactItemId aContactId);
IMPORT_C CContactIdArray* DeletedContactsLC();

3:DeleteContactsL bug fixed where it wouldn't send a changed message if it hit
an error after commiting some deletions.

4:Index on UID's dropped, this has reduced the file size considerably at the
expense of speed when importing contacts with non-native UID's

The file version number has been upped as a result of this. Old files will have
their uid index deleted. This appears to recover some of the space used for
the index but not all. You are recomended to delete old contacts files and
re-create them by synching.

5:Handle changed events arriving when tables are closed. These used to cause
a panic, the CContactDatabase::HandleDatabaseEventL() function now checks
for tables being closed and marks the sort array as out of date if an event
arrives when it's in this state.

6:When sending events with no meaningful iConnectionId value, it is now set
to zero instead of being left uninitialised.

7:Fixed importing a NULL VCard to delete a contact problem where it used to
ignore the decrement access count flag.

8:CContactDatabase::CompressRequired() will not leave now. If it gets an error
it will simply return EFalse.

Changed algorithm in CContactItemField::TemplateContentType() so it gives the
original content type for new contacts that have not yet been mapped onto a
template.

When launching the lock server under Marm the RProcess was not being closed,
this meant the lock server process would hang around until the calling
application exited.

CloseContactL() is confirmed as being a non-leaving function, although the
name can not be changed at this stage.

When importing entries preference is given to work rather than home when
neither is specified

Import/export now both support incrementing and decrementing of access
counts.

Version 0.00.041
================
Made by SteveT 2 Feb 1999

Fixed bug that caused contacts items without firstname/lastname go to the top
when first added.

Added function TVersion CContactDatabase::Version() const that returns the
current model version.

CContactDatabase::DeleteContactsL() has changed so it compresses if required
(as indicated by CompressRequired()), and also commits every 16 contacts
deleted.

The value reutrned by TPtrC CContactDatabase::FileUid() is now constant for
a particular file. This release only will patch old files created with CntModels
earlier than 040 to add this file UID.

Fixed more problems with DBMS giving locked and not found errors. AddContactL()
and DeleteContactL() now catch and retry when they receive these errors.

New functions:

TUint CContactDatabase::ConnectionId() const
reutrns the current connection id, this can be compared the connection id
of incoming messages that provide the id of the connection that generated
them.

CContactIdArray* CContactDatabase::ContactsChangedSinceL(const TTime& aTime)
Returns an array of contacts ids for all contacts changed since the specified
date.

void CContactDatabase::DeleteContactsL(const CContactIdArray& aContactIds);

Delete the specified array of contacts. One 'unspecified change' message
is sent instead of multiple deleted messages.

static void CContactDatabase::DeleteDefaultFileL();

Delete the default contacts file.

CContactIdArray* CContactDatabase::SortArrayL(const CContactIdArray* aIdArray, const CArrayFix<TSortPref>* aSortOrder);

Returns a sorted array of contacts.

const CContentType &CContactDatabase::TemplateContentType(const CContactItemField &aField) const

Returns the content type of the template entry the specified field maps onto.

const CContactTextDef* CContactDatabase::TextDefinition() const;

Returns the current text def.

CContactIdArray* CContactDatabase::FindInTextDefLC(const MDesCArray& aFindWords, const TCallBack &aWordParserCallback);
CContactIdArray* CContactDatabase::FindInTextDefLC(const MDesCArray& aFindWords,CContactTextDef* aTextDef, const TCallBack &aWordParserCallback);

CIdleFinder* CContactDatabase::FindInTextDefAsyncL(const MDesCArray& aFindWords,const CContactTextDef* aTextDef, MIdleFindObserver *aObserver, const TCallBack &aWordParserCallback);

Four overloads for the 'Find in text def' function. A find must match all
words in aFindWords. Functions without the CContactTextDef parameter use the
current default text def.

Once created the async versions work the same as the usual async find.

TFieldType CContactTextDef::FallbackField() const;

returns the type of the current fall back field.

TBool CContactItemField::IsValidLabel(const TDesC& aLabel,TInt& aInvalidPos)

Returns wether the label is valid or not, if not aInvalidPos is set as the
index of the first invalid character.

TPtrC CContactItem::UidStringL() const;

Version 0.00.025
================
Made by SteveT 08 December 1998

System template
Added a system template to the database, all database are now created with a system template, the id of this template can be found by calling 

	IMPORT_C TContactItemId TemplateId() const;

This template can be read and modified like any other entry, but don't delete it, you can at the moment but I think it will be banned in future.

Date format

The format of the date used in text def's, for sorting and for finding can be set by calling 

	IMPORT_C void SetDateFormatTextL(const TDesC &aFormat);

The format string is as used by TTime to format dates & times.

Phone match functions now declared as returning a TInt instead of a TBool.
	IMPORT_C TInt InitLoadPhoneMatchesL();
	IMPORT_C TInt LoadPhoneMatchesL();

Changed message changes

There's three new types of event
	EContactDbObserverEventTemplateChanged,
	EContactDbObserverEventTemplateDeleted,
	EContactDbObserverEventTemplateAdded,
All with the obvious meanings.
The old out of date EContactDbObserverEventChanged has gone properly now.

TStorageType
This is now a global typedef instead of a enum within CContactItemField

Version 0.00.024
================

F32/122 STORE/050 VERSIT/013 BAFL/086 CONVERT/023 CHARCONV/003 CONARC/005

Released to allow further UI & Connectivity development.  Must be used with 
ContacUi 013 or later

Not binary, source or data compatible with 023 (see 3 and 8 below)

From Steve
1) Added methods to edit the template entry which is now stored in the database.  This
is created along with the database.  To make this localisable, the template contents
are stroed in a new resource file - cntmodel.rss.

2) The resource file itself is private and will not be kept BC but a new resource header -
CNTTEM.RH is released in INCG.xxx

From Steph
3) Added support for altering the access count inside a vCard read/write.  This involed 
changing the enum arg to the import and export methods to a flags int, hence the source
incompatibility.

4) Further vCard fixes.

From Simon
5) First cut of new data structure to reduce file size.  At present this is controlled
by a set of #defines (largely to allow a file converter to be added soon).  Future
releases should leave __CDB_COMPRESSED set until the old scheme is no longer supported.
Don't set __CDB_COMRPESSING unless you want your file corrupted.

6) Changed the signature of CContactFieldStorage::RestoreL - hence the break of BC.  This 
shouldn't cause any problems as no-one could sensibly use this method outwith Cntmodel.

7) All variants of ReadContact and OpenContact now automatically add in any template fields
that aren't present in the stored contact.

8) Field labels should only be stored when different to that in the template.  This isn't 
yet working however.

9) Most test code is currently broken as a result of the above changes.

* modified contacts uid format to have ascii characters only.
* added support for the DOM versit parameter.
* API changes:
   removed CContactDatabase::TOptions:EincludeUid
	ExportSelectedContactsL always exports a UID.
	ImportContactsL looks in the stream for a uid value, if a value is 
	found and already  exist, the matching record will be updated. Otherwise a
	new record will be inserted.
   added CContactDatabase::TOptions:ETTFormat
	This will be used to indicate a special TT vcard format to the import/export 
	functions, but is not implemented yet.

(Made by SteveT, 12 October 1998)

Bug fixes
Record count was not initialised when a database was opened.
An unbalanced call to __UHEAP_MARK was being made in 
CContactDatabase::ReadBlobColL, this caused the alloc heaven check in cone to 
never fail even when there were left over cells.

New variant of CContactItemField::SetLabel
The new variant of SetLabel sets the label by taking ownership of an exisiting HBufC.

void CContactItemField::SetLabel(const HBufC* aLabel);

Added Asynchronus finding

Changed the change notificiation mechanism

New versions of CContactIdArray & CContactIdArray that construct the

All variants tested and released

Not file, source or binary compatible with 003

Added view definition and sorting to CContactDatabase.  Only synchronous sort is
currently supported.  See API.DOC or the test code for more information on how to 
use these.

Removed the special treatment given to names by CContactItem as it turned out to
be unhelpful and impossible to justify in practice.  Names should be added just 
like any other field now.

Defined a number of extra uids for vCard mappings etc. - see CNTDEF.H for details.

Replaced CContactIdArray and CContactFieldSet typedef'ed CArrays with wrapper classes 
of the same names.  See the docs or test code for more info on their use.

Fixed ROM building problems - all builds can be tested on p2 racks at least

Only WINS variants tested and released.

Updated API.DOC to include changes since 001

Fixed defects in CNTMODEL.OBY to allow test ROMs to be built.  All test code currently fails
on MARM due to problems starting the DBMS server.



Version 0.00.002

Uses:   DBMS/050 E32/126 E32TOOLS/091 E32TOOLS/091

Not compatible with 001

Only WINS variants tested

Converted to DBMS 050 and changed to make use of multiple client support.  Current DBMS
limitations mean its not possible to store anything else in the data file (e.g. UI 
preference streams, printer setup)

Added basic synchronous finding for any text column and support for row navigation - entry
identifiers no longer need to be stored by clients and persisted separately.



Version 0.00.001
================
(Made by SimonC, 12 May 1998)

Uses:   DBMS/038 E32/121 E32TOOLS/086 E32UTILS/019
		EIKTOOLS/125 F32/090 STORE/046

First release

Uses Platform 003 dependencies except for Eiktools which requires version 125 to
fetch unicode variants of everything.  Clients can safely build with 123.

All wins variants and marm rel released.  No other marm variants released as rom
images can't yet be successfully built so only rel could be tested.

Allows simple addition, editing and deletion of whole contacts.  These can contain 
any number of text fields but don't yet support other field types.  See ..\DOCS\API.DOC
for a description of the current API or the test code in ..\TSRC for example use.

Row navigation is not yet supported so clients should store the identifier returned when
adding an entry.

Can be released and built using the standard MNT and EBLD commands.

Note that nether binary nor file compatibility will be maintained in future releases.
