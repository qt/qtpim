This is used to specify the types of contact item that should be sorted and 
included in the view and the behaviour for items that cannot be sorted because 
they do not have content in any of the fields specified in the view's sort 
order.

The default behaviour is to include contact cards only and to sort contact 
cards without content in any of the sort order fields using the first available 
field containing any text.

The view preferences for all concrete contact view classes can be retrieved 
using their implementation of CContactViewBase::ContactViewPreferences(). 
The view preferences are set during construction of a CContactLocalView.

multiple clients can share the same server side view object, thereby reducing 
the overhead associated with initial sorting of the view data and keeping 
it in sync with the underlying data. Remote views should therefore be used
