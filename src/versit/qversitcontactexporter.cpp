  Process \a detail and provide a list of updated \l{QVersitProperty}{QVersitProperties} by
  modifying the \a toBeRemoved and \a toBeAdded lists.

  This function is called on every QContactDetail encountered during an export, after the detail has
  been processed by the QVersitContactExporter.  An implementation of this function can be made to
  provide support for QContactDetails not supported by QVersitContactExporter.

  The supplied \a contact is the container for the \a detail.  \a processedFields contains a list of
  fields in the \a detail that were considered by the QVersitContactExporter or another handler in
  processing the detail.  \a document holds the state of the document before the detail was
  processed by the exporter.

  \a toBeRemoved and \a toBeAdded are initially filled with a list of properties that the exporter
  will remove from and add to the document.  These lists can be modified (by removing, modifying or
  adding properties) by the handler to control the changes that will actually be made to the
  document.  If a property is to be modified in the document, the old version will appear in the
  \a toBeRemoved list and the new version will appear in the \a toBeAdded list.  When the handler
  uses a field from the detail, it should update the processedFields set to reflect this to inform
  later handlers that the field has already been processed.

  After the handler returns control back to the exporter, the properties in the \a toBeRemoved
  list will be removed and the properties in the \a toBeAdded list will be appended to the document.

/*!
  \class QVersitContactExporter
  \brief The QVersitContactExporter class converts \l {QContact}{QContacts} into
  \l {QVersitDocument}{QVersitDocuments}.
  \ingroup versit
  \inmodule QtVersit

  This class is used to convert lists of \l {QContact}{QContacts} (which may be stored in a
  QContactManager) into lists of \l {QVersitDocument}{QVersitDocuments} (which may be written to
  an I/O device using QVersitReader.  Unless there is an error, there is a one-to-one mapping
  between contacts and Versit documents.  The exporter can be extended by clients by associating
  resource and detail handlers.

  Here is a simple example of how to use QVersitContactExporter:
  \snippet qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Export example

  \section1 Extension via handlers

  A \l QVersitResourceHandler is associated with the exporter to supply the behaviour for loading
  files from persistent storage.  By default, this is set to a \l QVersitDefaultResourceHandler,
  which supports basic resource loading from the file system.  An alternative resource handler
  can be specified with setResourceHandler().

  By associating a \l QVersitContactExporterDetailHandlerV2 with the exporter using
  setDetailHandler(), the client can pass in a handler to override the processing of details and/or
  handle details that QVersitContactExporter doesn't support.  Also, handlers can be implicitly
  associated to an exporter through the \l{Qt Versit Plugins}{handler plugin mechanism}.  The exporter
  can be constructed with a profile, which gives hints about what kind of handlers should be added
  to it.  For example, the backup profile can be used to instruct the exporter to encode any unknown
  details in the vCard such that it can be reconstructed later (a QVersitContactImporter constructed
  under the backup profile can be used to decode it).  To illustrate, a backup exporter can be
  constructed with:
  \code
  QVersitContactExporter exporter(QVersitContactHandlerFactory::ProfileBackup);
  \endcode
  For more details on how the backup plugin works, see \l{Qt Versit Plugins}

  \section1 Exporting group relationships
  The exporter does not handle QContactRelationships at all.

  Some managers use the \l{QContactRelationship::HasMember()}{HasMember} QContactRelationship along
  with contacts of type \l{QContactType::TypeGroup}{TypeGroup} to indicate categorization of
  contacts.  In vCard, categorization is represented by the CATEGORIES property, which has
  semantics most similar to the QContactTag detail.  For contact manager backends that supports
  groups but not QContactTag, if the categorization information needs to be retained through
  CATEGORIES vCard properties, extra work can be done to convert from group relationships to
  QContactTag before passing the contact list to the exporter.  Below is some example code that
  does this translation.

  \snippet qtversitdocsample/qtversitdocsample.cpp Export relationship example

  \section1 Other implementation notes

  Some Android devices do not properly handle the \c FN vCard property.  If a
  DisplayLabel is set on a contact and this class is used to generate a vCard, the receiving device
  might display this label in an unexpected field (eg. Last Name).
  The vCard specification requires the \c FN property to be present.  However, because of this
  interoperability issue, Qt Versit only generates an FN property if a Displaylabel is set.
