  \class QVersitReader
  \brief The QVersitReader class provides an interface for reading versit
  documents such as vCards from a Stream.
  \ingroup versit
  \inmodule QtVersit

  QVersitReader concatenation of Versit documents such as vCards
  from a text stream and returns a list of QVersitDocument instances.
  QVersitReader supports reading from an abstract I/O device
  which can be, for example, a file or a memory buffer.
  The reading can be done asynchronously, and the
  waitForFinished() function can be used to make a blocking
  read.
